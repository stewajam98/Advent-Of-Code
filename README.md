# Advent-Of-Code

Advent of code is a yearly coding challenge set around the theme of christmas. Each year, starting on December 1st and continuing until christmas day, a two-part challenge is released that asks individuals to solve puzzles using code. The official site can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/). The code provided here are my attempts at each challenge. 

## Structure

This repository is broken out by the year of release and then the individual day. Each day's subdirectory will include a README file with that day's challenges (which can also be found on their official site linked above). It will then include the input files for that day, (sometimes) a smaller test input file for that day, and the code created by me to complete the task.

*At time of creating this repository, the site is currently being updated and so the puzzle for each day is not included. This will be fixed when the site is back up for public use*
